// names-new.js — name entities created in the map tool's review mode.
//
// SEPARATE FROM names.js ON PURPOSE. names.js is hand-authored: every entity
// there has had its namesake looked into and its lineage decided. Review needs
// to mint an id the moment a plat shows a label nobody has entered yet, and a
// browser tool should not be writing into the file that holds that research.
// Entities here are used by check-model.js and generate.js exactly as if they
// were in names.js, and are marked pendingResearch so nothing pretends they
// have been looked at.
//
// The lifecycle: research the namesake, fill in namedAfter / categories /
// sources, move the entity into names.js, delete it from here. Anything still
// sitting in this file is a to-do list.
//
// `sightings` is where to start on one: every sheet in the corpus that letters
// the name, with the ink each one uses. A name on three documents twenty years
// apart is a different research problem from one that appears once, and that is
// worth knowing before opening a browser. It is DERIVED — recomputed from
// documents/ on every review save — so do not hand-edit it; edit the rows.
//
// WRITTEN BY THE TOOL — it rewrites this file whole when you save a review, so
// hand edits to entities that are still listed here will be overwritten. Move
// an entity into names.js to make your edits stick.
